# GM1.4-Cube-marcher
For now the project is broken, as such i am creating this repository to share my failure with those that might help me out but do not have GM1.4 for me to share the project.
Cube marching is pretty interesting, you can read about it in http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/

also to not get confused, the one and only object in the whole project is obj_controller
